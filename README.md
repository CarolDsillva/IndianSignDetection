This project implements an Indian Sign Language (ISL) detection system using OpenCV and deep learning. The system captures hand gestures via a webcam, processes them using a hand-tracking module, and classifies the detected gestures using a trained deep learning model.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking and gesture detection
- Classification of Indian Sign Language gestures using a trained model
- Dynamic hand gesture recognition
- OpenCV-based image processing for accurate predictions

## Model Details
- **Total parameters**: 538,708
- **Trainable parameters**: 524,628
- **Non-trainable parameters**: 14,080

The model has been trained using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging a sequential architecture optimized for sign language classification.
